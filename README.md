# YawnByte:

This repository serves as the central hub for all tools and applications I have developed and designed. It includes a variety of projects, with SnailSynk being one of the key tools in this collection. The goal of this repository is to organize, maintain, and showcase my work, providing a cohesive environment for managing and deploying these tools. Each tool is designed with specific use cases in mind, focusing on usability, performance, and cross-platform compatibility.

# Purpose
The main repository is structured to:
    1. Centralize all my projects for easier access and maintenance.
    2. Provide clear documentation and setup instructions for each tool.
    3. Ensure consistent coding standards and best practices across all my projects.
